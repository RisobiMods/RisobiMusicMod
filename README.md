***MOD LIST***
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 #### Adds new custom RecordItem "brysontiller". 

>This disc plays the song "Dont" by Bryson Tiller from his album *T R A P S O U L* when used in a jukebox. The in-game item uses a custom texture, as well as a vanilla      style display name, complete with the correct rarity (RARE) that is used for vanilla Music Disc's.


 #### Adds "brysontiller" to the vanilla simple_dungeon chest loot table.

>"brysontiller" has a 30% spawn chance. (subject to change). For reference, Music Disc "cat" has a 21.5% spawn chance.


 #### Adds "brysontiller" to the creeper_drop_music_disc loot pool. 

>"brysontiller" will occasionally drop from creepers killed by skeletons. 


 #### Adds a new custom craft involving "brysontiller". 

>The recipe is one "brysontiller" disc placed in the center of the crafting table 3x3, surrounded by 8 diamonds. (subject to change). This craft "upgrades" the Music      Disc to a new "Platinum Disc" (item "brysontillerplat").


 #### Adds craftable item "brysontillerplat".

>This item has a higher rarity (EPIC), displays "Platinum Disc" instead of "Music Disc", uses a new texture, and plays a stereo sound file instead of the usual mono        sound file. Therefore, the sound from the jukebox is played for the entire server at a consistent volume, regardless of the players distance from the jukebox.
